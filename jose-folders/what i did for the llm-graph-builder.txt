Information on neo4j graph builder

tool online: https://llm-graph-builder.neo4jlabs.com/ need to create an account on neo4j aura

github: https://github.com/neo4j-labs/llm-graph-builder/blob/main/README.md

I followed the readme:

Added an open ai api key to the .env file in backend folder 

then ran the command:
docker-compose up --build

This docker build took around 20 minutes 

The local website asks for authentication, like in the online version, but it doesn't work like in the online version. I didn't know what to change here
