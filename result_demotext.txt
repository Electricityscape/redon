Energy storage systems play an important role in a diverse range of industrial applications [1], [2], as either bulk energy storage or distributed transient energy buffer. Specific energy, specific power, lifetime, reliability, and safety are among the main criteria considered when picking energy storage [3]. On the other hand, supercapacitors (SCs), also known as ultracapacitors (UCs) or Electric Double-Layer Capacitors (EDLCs), are being actively studied and unanimously envisaged as a promising energy storage technology, owing to their desirable merits including high power density and high degree of recyclability [6], [7]. For example, accurate and efficient modeling is fundamental for management system development regarding electrical, thermal, and aging issues [11]. Besides, precise state estimation provides insights for cell non-uniformity suppression and optimal power control of SC systems. There is a large body of literature reporting on advances in SC modeling, state estimation, and their industrial applications. First, we review virtually all the modeling approaches applied to SCs, including electrochemical, equivalent circuit, intelligent, and fractional-order models, especially underscoring the most recent modeling outcomes. Third, we elucidate a broad variety of SC applications, especially focusing on the energy management development of SC-involved systems.
